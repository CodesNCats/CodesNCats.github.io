        <td width="690" valign="top"><p class="body">Lifescapes; portraits that reveal the subjects story through gesture and   surroundings transformed into visual story telling. Through   composition, line, form, and finely finished surfaces, P. Smallwood   creates compelling portraits that convey a feeling about how the   subjects live their lives.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="Images/Desire.jpg" alt="Desire by P. Smallwood" width="269" height="192" hspace="10" class="img_rt" />Smallwood has an artists' agenda. The   ability to engage the viewer to pause, take note, and connect with the   subject's emotional experience of life is powerful and deliberate. The   focus of his work is for viewers to experience the common thread of   emotions, aspirations, and desires of the people he paints from rural   America to the streets of the urban inner city. They are faces many   viewers typically do not bother to notice, or skim over as unimportant. Smallwood's Lifescapes put them center stage. He holds them up and   honors them.<br />
          <br />
          As a primarily self-taught artist, the process by   which he creates Lifescapes is intuitive and exploratory. Artworks are   born from his own intrinsic observations rather than from any particular   artistic school. His artistic vision is unique, specific and   intentional. His work is highly drafted and finely finished.<br />
          <br />
          Smallwood   is striving for the seamless surface of a constructed realism. His   subjects are tightly drafted with keen attention to perspective, form   and how the light spectrum falls on the subject to tell the visual   story. These elements are most apparent in his subject's skin tone,   which has a smooth finish that reflects his fascination with both figure   drawing and watercolor painting.<br />
          <br />
          There is no romanticizing or   masking of the human complexity of the subject's life. Even with   Smallwoods' artistic manipulations, it is realism of the deepest form. It is the subject and emotional landscape of the life being portrayed   that Smallwood wants us to recognize and identify with. </p></td>
