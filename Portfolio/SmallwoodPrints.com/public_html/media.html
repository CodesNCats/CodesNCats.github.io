            <strong>May 2010</strong></p>
          <p class="body"><strong><br />
            New Milford, NJ - </strong>Water  color artist Philip Smallwood, known   for his signature watercolor paintings, or  as he calls them,   &quot;lifescapes,&quot; has completed a series of six original works  that depict a   young African American male growing up in the Bronx, New York  City and   all of the challenges of a metropolitan urban environment that he    faces. <br />
            <br />
            The focal point of this series is  someone who Smallwood has worked with on several projects.<br />
            <br />
            Smallwood observed the young man was  at a crossroads in his life,   where his choices were either to become a strong  independent person or   fall victim to the many negative influences that envelope  inner- city   youth.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I found Rasheed to be a good person,  ambitious, hard working, and   hoped that my mentoring would help point him in  the right direction,&quot;   Smallwood said reflecting back on his relationship. &quot;I  was hopefully   able to connect with this young person and make an impact.&quot;</p>
          <p class="body"><img src="Images/Redemption.jpg" alt="Redemption" width="152" height="205" class="img_rt" />Smallwood's hope is that observers of  his work will pause and take a   closer look at the person. The intent is to  intimately share with the   viewer something they may, or would not see in their  everyday travels.<br />
            <br />
            Being a portrait painter, Smallwood's  objective is to provide the   viewer with a more intimate look at what might  seemingly be a common   person or moment.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;Through my paintings, I ask the  viewer to stop, engage, and   experience the individual lives portrayed- with all  of their   aspirations, dreams and desires, seeing them as worthy of  observation,&quot;   Smallwood explained.<br />
            <br />
            &quot;I want to bring my subjects into the  world in a majestic and   profound way, to put them on a pedestal and make them  royalty in terms   of artistic content.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            This is the reason that Smallwood and  others refer to his paintings   as &quot;lifescapes&quot; visual imagery that translates  into a powerful form of   portraiture. <br />
            <br />
            Through his work in watercolor,  Smallwood has found a medium that   allows him to blend his love of the human  form with light, color, and a   fluid surface ideal for telling the human  narrative that has become   the heartbeat of his work.<br />
            <br />
            Smallwood's work has been shown in  solo and group exhibitions   nationwide including Carolina Galleries, Bryant Galleries,  Craven   Gallery, The Parish Art Museum, and The Studio Museum of Harlem.<br />
            <br />
            Other works and more information can  be found on Smallwood's web site at www.psmallwood.com.</p>

          <p class="body">Watercolor artist Phil Smallwood of New Milford recently participated in a first-of-its-kind art exhibition held at the Bergen County administration building in Hackensack - and received a commendation from Congress for doing so.</p>
            <p class="body">Smallwood, along with three other artists - Jim Edmonds and Jacqueline Collier of Teaneck, and Moses Groves of Englewood - displayed their works there throughout February in connection with Black History Month.</p>
            <p class="body">&quot;The historical significance of this showing is that this was   the first time that African-American artwork was solely exhibited in a   public building in Bergen County,&quot; Smallwood said</p>
            <p class="body">Smallwood said the title of the exhibition was &quot;Art From the   Soul,&quot; which was curated by Joanne Bryant Reed, an assistant chairwoman   for the Romare-Bearden Foundation and retired Meryl Lynch executive.</p>
            <p class="body">The four artists were honored at a reception at One Bergen County Plaza, attended by members of the community and county officials, Smallwood said.</p>
            <p class="body">They were presented with a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from Rep. Steve Rothman's Fair Lawn office, along with a Certificate of Commendation from the county, presented by County Executive Dennis McNerney.</p>
            <p class="body">Bryant-Reed praised Smallwood and said that his artwork, &quot;always connects with the audience.&quot;</p>
            <p class="body">&quot;His work is detailed and you find yourself in the scene as a participant not as a viewer, but as a real participant,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p class="body">&quot;His artwork has a way of drawing you in... Phil is inspired by   life itself and uses his surroundings and memories to determine what he   wants to say with his work.&quot;</p>
            <p class="body">Besides being part of the exhibition in Hackensack, Smallwood has earned some other honors as well.</p>
            <p class="body">&quot;I was selected 'Best in Show' at the 24th annual International   Art Exhibition in Philadelphia,&quot; he said, &quot;the first watercolor artist   garnering this distinction in the history of the exhibition.&quot; Smallwood   also took first place at the New Jersey Watercolor Society member show,   which was held at the Guild of Creative Art in Shrewsbury last fall.   Smallwood has been a &quot;signature member&quot; of the organization for the past   10 years.</p>

          <p class="subhead">Smallwood's watercolors are 'Lifescapes'</p>

            When Philip Smallwood rides in a New York cab, he   doesn't just watch the meter. He often studies the cab driver in the   rear-view mirror, examining his wrinkles, or the lack of them and the   expression in his eyes. 
          </p>
          <p class="body">Upon reaching his destination, Smallwood may ask permission to shoot   the cabbie's photograph as the possible template for a watercolor. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;Mostly, they say 'yes,' &quot; Smallwood says in an interview from his   home studio in Milford, N.J. &quot;Sometimes, if I'm in a car and stop at a   red light and someone standing nearby looks interesting, or somebody   intriguing is walking down Broadway, I may just snap the photo right   then. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;However, if I'm in a restaurant and notice someone I want to sketch,   I go over and introduce myself, tell them what I'm doing so they will   be at ease; usually they are flattered,&quot; explains Smallwood. </p>
    <p class="body">Born in New Jersey, the artist has connections to South Carolina. One   of his sisters lives in Sumter, and his mother lived there for a time. </p>
    <p class="body">Smallwood first visited Charleston in 1996 when he made the first of   many tours through the Southeast, which inspired a body of work   influenced by Southern rural families. </p>
    <p class="body">In celebration of Black History Month, Smallwood's exhibit,   &quot;Lifescapes,&quot; featuring 20 of his watercolors, opens Friday at Carolina   Galleries, 106-A Church St. </p>
    <p class="body">The African-American artist will be honored at a reception at 5-8   p.m. Friday, followed by a lecture on his work at 6:30 p.m. Both events   are free and open to the public. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;Lifescapes&quot; runs through February. </p>
    <p class="body">Although mainly consisting of scenes from the South, the collection   also includes several paintings depicting a boy growing up in New York   City, which Smallwood says marks a shift to a more edgy, intense urban   setting. </p>
    <p class="body">Smallwood calls his style &quot;Lifescapes&quot; because his goal is to engage   the viewer and make him wonder about the subject's aspirations, dreams   and desires. </p>
    <p class="body">Growing up in New Jersey, Smallwood considered going into medicine   and enrolled in the pre-med program at the University of Miami. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;In anatomy classes, I drew the human figure a great deal, and when   growing up, I was interested in tracing and then drawing,&quot; he says.   &quot;Also, as a child, I was influenced by Norman Rockwell's illustrations   for the covers of the Saturday Evening Post; I felt you truly had a   glimpse into these people's lives.&quot;</p>
    <p class="body">The artist is often inspired by people who aren't having it so good these days. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;These are people often overlooked because of their specific   circumstances,&quot; he says. &quot;I want viewers to get a really good look at   these people.&quot; </p>
    <p class="body">Smallwood is now painting the portrait of saxophonist Tony Smith for Smith's new CD cover. </p>
    <p class="body">&quot;I'm a huge jazz fan,&quot; says Smallwood. &quot;One of my greatest thrills   was when I was commissioned to paint a portrait of Duke Ellington for   the Duke Ellington Centennial.&quot;<br />
    </p>
    <p class="body">The artist signs his work, &quot;P. Smallwood&quot; and has exhibited in The   Studio Museum in Harlem, The Parrish Museum in South Hampton, N.Y., and   at the Philadelphia International Expo. </p>
  

<h2 class="subhead">Special Art Opening of P. Smallwood's Watercolor Paintings at Carolina Galleries, <br />
  February 5</h2>
            <p class="body">January 18, 2010 by <a href="http://cfada.wordpress.com/author/cfada/" title="Posts by cfada">cfada</a></p>
<p class="body">Watercolor artist P. (Philip) Smallwood will be talking about his Charleston and regionally focused work at <a href="http://www.carolinagalleries.com"><strong>Carolina Galleries</strong></a>. Philip will be in the gallery for a special opening of his watercolor paintings on February 5, 2010 from 5-8 pm, with an artists lecture at 6:30 p.m.<a href="http://cfada.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/psmallwood.jpg"><img src="Images/Prints/Desire.jpg" alt="Desire" width="300" height="205" class="img_lf" /></a></p>
<p class="body">Philip   Smallwood is known for his signature &quot;Lifescapes&quot;, a wonderful form of   portraiture and visual narrative. His Lifescapes are intended to engage   the viewer and allow them to connect with the subject's emotional   experience of life. In his painting Destiny, the little girl looks   directly at the viewer. Her expression and the detail of her face draw   the viewer in and wanting to know more about her. In other works, the   viewer feels as if they have walked into a slice of the subjects life.</p>
<p class="body">&quot;Through my paintings, I ask the viewer to stop, engage and   experience the individual lives portrayed - with all their aspirations,   dreams and desires - and really see them as worthy of their   observation. I want to bring my subjects into the world in a majestic   and profound way, to put them on a pedestal and make them royalty in   terms of the artistic content.&quot; Smallwood explains.</p>
            <p class="body">As a primarily self-taught artist, the process by which he creates a   Lifescape is intuitive and exploratory. Philip creates from his own   vision rather from any particular artistic school. His artistic vision   is unique, specific and intentional. Philip Smallwood's work is also   highly drafted and finely finished. Before becoming a full time fine   artist, Philip founded Woodtopia, Inc., a furniture fabrication and   design company that produced commercial and one-of-a-kind artisan   pieces. The artisan works, including functional objects such as tables   and chairs, challenged the traditional expectation of line and form. The experience of designing and woodworking enabled Smallwood to   experiment with volume, line, form, finish and artistic representation. These are all elements that play an important role in the composition   of Philip's work today. Examples of his use of form and line are   evident in his watercolor<em> My Turn</em>, which is on display at Carolina   Galleries now. This piece gives a window frame, with its' dark vertical   and horizontal lines, an important part in the overall composition.</p>
            <p class="body">Smallwood, who currently resides in New Jersey, spent many years   living and traveling throughout the Southeast and much of his work is   inspired by rural families in the South. Charleston has always been   source of inspiration for Philip. However, Smallwood is currently   working on a new body of work that highlights a young man growing up in   New York City. This new series marks a shift to a more edgy and   intense urban setting. This recent body of work gives a sense a   familiarity to anyone who lives in a metropolitan city in the US. A few   pieces from this series will be on view at Carolina Galleries on   February 5th. Philip Smallwood is often inspired by people   who may be experiencing unfortunate circumstances. He enjoys portraying   them in an idealist way. He believes this gives the viewer a chance to   really look at the good in these people. His subjects are often people   that a viewer may not take the time to get to know because of their   specific circumstances.</p>
            <p class="body">Smallwood attended the University of Miami and graduated with a B.S.   in Biology and a Minor in Art.Â  Through watercolor, Smallwood found a   medium that allowed him to blend his love of the human form with light,   color and a fluid surface ideal for telling the human narrative that has   become the heartbeat of his work.Â  Today, his Lifescape watercolors are   the culmination of his artistic relationships with structure, shape,   volume, finish, light and color filtered through the eye of his life   experiences and values.</p>
            <p class="body">Philip's work has been shown in solo and group exhibitions, including   The Craven Gallery, The Parrish Art Museum in South Hampton and The   Studio Museum in Harlem. In October of 2009, Philip was honored with   'Best in Show' at the Philadelphia International Art Expo. Last year, he   also was awarded by the New Jersey Watercolor Society for his   outstanding work.</p>
