          Watercolor Painter 
        </p>
          <p class="body"><img src="Images/P.-Smallwood.jpg" alt="Watercolor artist Philip Smallwood" width="208" height="311" class="img_lf" />Watercolor  painter <strong><em>Philip Smallwood </em></strong>(b. 1957) is known for his  signature watercolor paintings - Lifescapes - a powerful form of portraiture and  visual narrative. His artistic vision is  unique, specific and intentional, and he strives to create from that vision  rather from any particular artistic school. Smallwood portrays the subject within his or her natural environment,  carefully manipulated to evoke an emotional connection with the viewer.</p>
<p class="body">Smallwood's  watercolor paintings have been sought out for solo and group exhibitions from  prestigious galleries and museums including The Parrish Art Museum in South  Hampton and The Hammonds House Museum in Atlanta. P. Smallwood was also selected as one of top  30 African American artists from across the nation to be showcased in <em>Black Romantic</em> at the Studio Museum in  Harlem. Reviewing that show, Michael  Kimmelman of the New York Times wrote &quot;Philip Smallwood represents the show's  prevailing strain of social pride, painting sun-drenched scenes of quaint humanity.&quot;</p>
          <p class="body">Recently  Philip's work received Best in Show at the International Art Expo in  Philadelphia and took first prize in a New Jersey Watercolor Society  exhibition. In 2010, he was also awarded a Certificate of Special Congressional  Recognition for his work related to the Art of Soul exhibition held by Bergen  County, New Jersey. Later in the year, Philip  unveiled his new Urban series in a solo show at Carolina Galleries in  Charleston, South Carolina. His work has  been shown at Bryant Gallery in New Orleans and Carol Craven Gallery in  Martha's Vineyard. Earlier in his  career, Smallwood was selected to create a commissioned work for the Duke  Ellington Centennial Commission at the Charlin Jazz Society in Washington  DC.</p>          <p class="body">Through  watercolor, Smallwood found a medium that allowed him to blend his love of the  human form with light, color and a fluid surface ideal for telling the human  narrative that has become the heartbeat of his work. Today, his Lifescape watercolors are the  culmination of his artistic relationships with structure, shape, volume, finish, light and color  filtered through the eye of his life experiences and values. His approach to watercolor technique, from  composition to form and surface, is intuitive and exploratory. His subjects are people most viewers would  ignore or overlook as of little importance. Smallwood takes these subjects and puts them center stage.</p></td>
