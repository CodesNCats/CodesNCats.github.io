Comments: Forgive me for reaching out through your contact form, but I thought it would be less intrusive than cold calling.  I am a very skilled web developer that is looking for new projects/clients.  I was just on your site and it's a nice site, but it could be amazing.  I would really like to help you with it.  Are you interested in redesigning the site or adding some features?  I have a lot of ideas I'd like to share with you.    

Let me know if you're interested in speaking and hearing some of my ideas as well as getting a proposal.  I'd really love to help with your site.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks!

Tyler Webb
