Comments: This is a comment to the website creator. I discovered your Contact Artist | P. Smallwood page by searching on Google but it was hard to find as you were not on the front page of search results. I know you could have more visitors to your site. I have found a site which offers to dramatically improve your rankings and traffic to your website: http://hdmh.info/37 I managed to get close to 500 visitors/day using their service, you could also get many more targeted visitors from Google than you have now. Their service brought significantly more visitors to my website. I hope this helps!
